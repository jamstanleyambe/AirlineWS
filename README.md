Part A: Creating the Airline Company Project
In the realm of the airline industry, the problem of overbooking flights has become a significant challenge. To tackle this issue, we can leverage web services technology and the principle of interoperability to create a comprehensive solution. In this scenario, we will focus on developing a book management application using web services technology to showcase how interoperability can be applied to address the problem of airline overbooking. We will assume that different clients developed over the years are used by customers from different branches of an airline company. The customers from Branch A use a PHP client, those from Branch B use a Java client, and the customers from Branch C use a Python client. Using your expertise in web services and JAX-WS (Java API for XML Web Services), let's explore how interoperability can be harnessed to resolve the challenges of airline overbooking.
1. Open your preferred IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, NetBeans, etc.) and create a new project called "AirlineCompany".
2. Create an "Aircraft" entity with the following attributes: id: integer, model: string, capacity: integer, and range: integer. Additionally, create and initialize a list of aircraft with three entities/models.
3. Create a "Booking" entity with the following attributes: id: integer, flightNumber: string, passengerName: string, and seatNumber: string.
4. Create a "Passenger" entity with the following attributes: id: integer, name: string, age: integer, and nationality: string.
5. Define the Data Access Layer (DAL):
 Implement methods for adding an aircraft, retrieving all aircraft, adding a
booking, retrieving all bookings, adding a passenger, and retrieving all
passengers.
6. Define the Business Layer (BL):
 Implement methods for adding an aircraft, retrieving all aircraft, adding a booking, retrieving all bookings, adding a passenger, and retrieving all passengers.
 This layer will handle the business logic and interact with the DAL.
7. Define the Web Service Layer (WS):
 Create a class called "AirlineWS" that acts as the web service.
 Implement the following web service methods:
 "searchByModel" method: Takes a model as input and returns a list of aircraft matching the model.
 "addAircraft" method: Adds an aircraft to the database.
 "getAllAircraft" method: Retrieves all aircraft from the database.
 "addBooking" method: Adds a booking to the database.
 "getAllBookings" method: Retrieves all bookings from the database.
 "addPassenger" method: Adds a passenger to the database.
 "getAllPassengers" method: Retrieves all passengers from the database.
Part B: Creating Different Types of Clients
1. Generating the Stub and Skeleton:
 Use the "wsgen" tool to generate the stub and skeleton of your web service.
 This will create the necessary artifacts for client-side and server-side
communication.
2. Testing the Web Service:
 You can perform tests using tools like Oxygen or SoapUI.
 Use these tools to send requests to your web service and verify the responses. 3. Consuming the Web Service using PHP:
 To consume the web service using PHP, you can use the SOAP extension.
 Write a PHP client code to consume the web service:
4. Consuming the Web Service using python:
 Write a python client code to consume the web service:
